### 2) Individual responsibilities

Each member is responsible for completing tasks & assignments before the assigned deadline. If anything occurs, and they are not able to finish the task before the deadline, make sure to let the team know as soon as possible and discuss with them a solution. 

Members must be reachable. They are expected to respond to or otherwise acknowledge communications (email, etc).

### 3) General Meeting Schedule

We will finish our work during class, else we will schedule a free based on the schedule above. 

### 4) Plan for Rotating Note-Keeper

Every week, one team member will be responsible for taking notes on class material that is relevant for group work. This cycle will start with Nalla, then Aiden, then Carmen, then Harrison and rotate accordingly.

### 5) Accountability

This seemed pretty deliberately copied off the example. Can we redo this? Also, we need to be more specific on what or how: When will you escalate to me? Can you document the issue before bringing it up to me? (I will say yes you will have to do so as consequence for copying.)

### 6) Conflict

Team members will meet and discuss to attempt to handle conflict internally. 

### 7) Code of Ethics

Act and speak respectfully
Make sure to communicate your problems or concerns to the team
Finish your work on time
