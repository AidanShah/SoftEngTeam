### 2) Individual responsibilities

All members should complete their individual work before deadlines agreed upon by the team. Should this not be the case, members should communciate with the rest of the team to keep them informed. For group work that needs to be split into tasks, the split will discussed in class and then an email will be sent that includes the tasks with the assigned people. All members should respond to email communications within 24 hours.

### 3) General Meeting Schedule

We will finish our work during class, else we will schedule a free based on the schedule above. 

### 4) Plan for Rotating Note-Keeper

Every class, one team member will be responsible for taking notes on things that are they deem relevant to group projects. This cycle will start with Nalla, then Aidan, then Carmen, then Harrison and rotate accordingly.

### 5) Accountability

We will try to keep each other accountable by utilizing a court of ethics run by the other members of the team to keep everyone adhering to the contract. These members will rule on the punishment/resolution to the conflict.

### 6) Conflict

Team members will meet and discuss to attempt to handle conflict internally. 

### 7) Code of Ethics

* Act and speak respectfully
* Make sure to communicate your problems or concerns to the team
* Finish your work on time
